### Description:
#### Introduction:

This README outlines the *Tourism Expenditure* app, a Processing application designed to visualize inbound tourism expenditure in the EU and UK from 1995 to 2022. This app allows users to observe tourism expenditure trends over the years, revealing how countries like Spain have increased their income over time. It also highlights the dramatic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on tourism. 

#### Dataset:

The dataset used in this app consists of two TXT files: one containing inbound expenditure data (*TourismExpenditure.txt*) and the other showing growth compared to the previous year (*TourismExpChange.txt*). Both files are disaggregated by country and year. The original dataset is an Excel file, available for download from [unwto](https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/tourism-statistics-database). The original file has been processed using Python to generate the final TXT files.

#### Libraries:

The required libraries are listed in the *requirements.txt* file. The app has been implemented in Processing, a programming language and environment used for visual arts and data visulization. You can learn more about Processing at https://processing.org/.

#### Features

* The app initially displays inbound tourism expenditure on the x-axis and growth (compared to the previous year) on the y-axis for EU and UK countries in 1995. Each country is represented by its flag.

* The size and transparency of the flags can be adjusted through the app's settings.

* Users can change the displayed year using a slider, and pressing the play button activates an animation that automatically scrolls through the years.

* Using the left legend, users can toggle the visibility of individual countries.

* Pressing the 'H' key displays help information.
